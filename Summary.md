  The program works off of yt-dlp and ffmpeg, I didn't include ffmpeg so would need to setup that on your computer first. 
This was just a pet project to not have to use websites to convert youtube video to mp3. I am trying to use my skills to make everyday
items I used before local rather going through a third-party website. I think limiting your footprint on the web is going to
be a skill everyone is going to need as time goes on.
